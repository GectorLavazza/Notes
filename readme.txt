This is a test note.
Just testing things ya know :3

This line is super loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong. See?

	This line starts with a tab (press [F1] to toggle tab view)
    but this one starts with 4 spaces

	Btw there's an auto indentation (press [RETURN] anywhere on this line)

Delete that (use [Command])
Delete THAT or	THAT (use [Option])

There are some commands. You have to type them on a new line.
    _eval: 2 + 2 =
    _rev: abcd
    _bin: 100
